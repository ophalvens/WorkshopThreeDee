# Workshop Programming
## Context
* This project contains the starting code and the 'finished' code of the Workshop Programming.
* We will build a small 3D world with some interaction.
* This is not meant to be a best-practices example. Some corners are cut ...
  * no rights to install software
  * no access to a local or online server
  * no pre-installed IDE
  * the participants have varying and unknown prior IT knowledge and experience

Still, I hope you'll enjoy this Workshop!
